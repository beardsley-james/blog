The Fantasy Battle Generator is my attempt to simulate the flow of combat in a tabletop roleplaying game, only in a more lonely single-player way with no clear delineation between PC and NPC. It generates strings to output to a combat display based on behind-the-scenes die rolls and the status of the two players. Plans for the future include the concept of range and limited ammunition, with a moderate chance for magical attacks and statuses at some point.
